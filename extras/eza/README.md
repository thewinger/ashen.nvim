[!WARNING]
`eza` prioritizes the contents of the `LS_COLORS` environment variable.
It is recommended to `unset LS_COLORS` in your shell `rc` file, otherwise
some colors set by the theme may not be respected.

To install this theme, kindly download `theme.yml` and place it inside your `~/.config/eza`.
